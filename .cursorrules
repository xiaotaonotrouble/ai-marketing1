I have experience in coding, but i have only a little experience in web developing. 
1. So for every move, make sure it's not too big. Don't overwelme me with a lot of new files and a lot of new code. Make sure every move is manageable and digestable for me.
2. Clearly and efficiently organize files and code. Give clear and necessary comments, filenames.
3. 每一次代码修改，都添加简短的注释，让我明白你做了什么。
